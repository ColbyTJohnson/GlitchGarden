## About the Game

### The Game
The game was designed by Ben Tristem and was developed by myself as part of working through his [Unity/C# Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/unitycourse/learn/v4/overview). The project focused on optimizing games for mobile, and was built to iOS, Android, and Windows/MacOS. Assets were provided mainly by the wonderful developers of [Glitch](https://www.glitchthegame.com/public-domain-game-art/).
